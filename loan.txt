3. Data Usage
The dataset can be used for multiple purposes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze key features, distribution patterns, and relationships to understand credit risk factors.
Classification: Build predictive models to classify the loan_status variable (approved/not approved) for potential applicants.
Regression: Develop regression models to predict the credit_score variable based on individual and loan-related attributes.
Mind the data issue from the original data, such as the instance > 100-year-old as age.

This dataset provides a rich basis for understanding financial risk factors and simulating predictive modeling processes for loan approval and credit scoring.
